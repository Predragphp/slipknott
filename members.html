		<div id="demo" class="collapse">					
		<p>Corey Todd Taylor is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor and author, best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the American heavy metal band Slipknot and the American hard rock and alternative metal band Stone Sour.</p>

		<p>Born	December 8, 1973
				Des Moines, Iowa, US<br>

		<br>Also known as:<br>	
				#8, The Great Big Mouth, The Sickness, The Boogie Knight, Neck, CMFT, Todd Tigger, 666, The Heretic, The Grim Chopper</p>
							
		<p>Personal life

		Corey Todd Taylor was born in Des Moines, Iowa on December 8, 1973. Taylor was mostly raised by his mother in Waterloo, Iowa, a place described by Taylor as a "hole in the ground with buildings around it." He is of German and Native American background from his father's side and Irish and Dutch on his mother's side. Taylor was raised by his single mother. He developed a fond feeling toward rock 'n' roll after his grandmother introduced him to Elvis Presley.<br><br>

		In 1979, Taylor and his mother saw the science fiction series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Before the series, there was a trailer for the 1978 horror film Halloween. Taylor said this "developed some sense of Slipknot in [himself]." While Halloween introduced Taylor to masks and horror themes, Taylor's grandmother introduced him to rock music, showing him a collection of Elvis Presley records from the mid-fifties to late seventies. He especially found some songs like "Teddy Bear", "In the Ghetto", and "Suspicious Minds", to appeal to his interests the most, describing them as "good times." Taylor also began listening to Black Sabbath at a young age, beginning with their early work.<br><br>

		Taylor, along with his mother and sister, lived at one point in an "old dilapidated farmhouse," which on days in late autumn would "look like Black Sabbath album covers." By age fifteen, Taylor had developed a drug addiction and had overdosed on cocaine twice. By this time, Taylor was living in Waterloo, Iowa, but later set out on his own and ended up at his grandmother's house in Iowa. She took legal custody of him and helped him buy musical equipment. When Taylor was eighteen, he left his grandmother's home and went to various places, Des Moines being a place to which he frequently returned.<br><br>

		At age 17, when Taylor was living with his grandmother, he attempted suicide by way of overdose. Taylor's ex-girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him. He describes this as the lowest point in his life.<br><br>

		Taylor and his father first met when Taylor was 30 years old, and now have a relationship, although he said their paths do not cross that often. On September 17, 2002, Taylor's then-fiancée, Scarlett, gave birth to their son Griffin Parker. Taylor also has a daughter named Angeline from an earlier relationship. Taylor and Scarlett married on March 11, 2004, and divorced three years later..<br><br>

		Taylor has also had alcohol abuse problems, which his wife, Scarlett, helped him through as well as keeping him from committing suicide. In 2006, Taylor told MTV that he had attempted to jump off a balcony of the eighth floor of the Hyatt on Sunset Boulevard in 2003, but "somehow [Scarlett] stopped me". This was later recanted by Taylor in an interview with Kerrang! radio and stated that it was, in fact, his friend Thom Hazaert who stopped him from jumping. Scarlett then told him that either he would have to get sober or she would annul their marriage. Before Stone Sour started recording Come What(ever) May in January 2006, Taylor was sober.<br><br>

		On August 3, 2009, he co-hosted the 2009 Kerrang! Awards alongside Scott Ian of Anthrax. The following year, they both once again co-hosted The Kerrang Awards, where Corey collected the K! Services to Metal award on behalf of Paul Gray who died after an accidental overdose of morphine and fentanyl.<br><br>

		In early September 2010, Taylor announced that his book, Seven Deadly Sins: Settling The Argument Between Born Bad And Damaged Good would be released on July 12, 2011 through Da Capo Press.<br><br>

		On November 13, 2009, Taylor married Stephanie Luby at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.</p><br><br>	
					
		<p>Slipknot<br><br>

		Taylor performing with Slipknot in 2011.
		In Des Moines, Iowa, Joey Jordison, Shawn Crahan, and Mick Thomson approached him asking him to join Slipknot. He agreed to go to one of their practices, and ended up singing in front of them. Of Slipknot's nine members, Corey was the sixth to join the band. Performing with Slipknot, he would also come to be known as "Number Eight", being that the band follows a numbering scheme for its members, ranging from 0 - 8. According to Shawn Crahan, Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizes infinity.<br><br>

		Feeling he could expand more inside Slipknot than in Stone Sour, Taylor temporarily quit Stone Sour, even though they were recording an album with Sean McMahon. Taylor's first gig with Slipknot was on August 22, 1997, which according to band members did not go well. During his first gig, Taylor did not perform wearing a mask; however, for his second show nearly a month later, Corey wore a mask that resembles his debut album mask. Taylor's current mask was described by MTV's Chris Harris as looking "as though it were made of dried, human flesh—like Leatherface, if only he used moisturizer."<br><br>

		Taylor has recorded with Slipknot since the release of their second demo album, a self-titled demo used to promote the band to prospective labels and producers. As permanent vocalist, he recorded with Slipknot at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California and released Slipknot, the band's debut album that peaked number one on the Top Heatseekers chart, went double platinum in the United States, and was included in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Taylor was accused of copyright infringement, regarding the lyrics of the song "Purity", but no action was taken. Taylor began recording for their second studio album, Iowa, in 2001 at Sound City and Sound Image in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. It was released August 28, 2001 and peaked number one on the UK Albums Chart, as well as number three on the Billboard 200. While writing Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), Taylor decided to write lyrics that would not warrant an explicit label. It peaked number two on the Billboard 200. All Hope Is Gone was the first Slipknot album to peak number one on the Billboard 200.</p><br><br>

		<h2>Mickael Thomson</h2><input type="button" class="btn sty" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo1" value="&#x25bc;"style="color: black;">
		<div id="demo1" class="collapse">
		<p>Mickael Gordon "Mick" Thomson is an American heavy metal musician. Born in Des Moines, Iowa, he is best known as one of two guitarists in Slipknot, in which he is designated #7. Thomson originally met founding Slipknot members Anders Colsefni, Donnie Steele and Paul Gray through their mutual involvement in death metal band Body Pit, and later replaced Craig Jones in the group in 1996. Following the departure of Joey Jordison in 2013, Thomson is now the third longest-serving member of Slipknot.</p>

		<p>Born	November 3, 1973
		Des Moines, Iowa, USA<br>

                <br>Also known as:<br>

                          #7, Mick, Mr. Seven, Number Seven</p>

<p>Mick Thomson grew up having a "fascination with death metal bands", including Morbid Angel, although he has also named The Beatles as one of his major musical influences. He began his career playing guitar in a number of local bands in his hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, most notably death metal outfit Body Pit, formed in 1993. Original Slipknot members Anders Colsefni (vocals), Donnie Steele (guitar) and Paul Gray (bass) were all fellow members of Body Pit during this period. In addition to performing in the band, Thomson gave guitar lessons to local students at Ye Olde Guitar Shop on 70th Street in Des Moines.</p>
		
<p>His early career in music started in bands such as Body Pit, which included other members who were to be in Slipknot. He joined Slipknot under a recommendation from Joey Jordison, and replaced Craig Jones on guitar, who moved to samples/media. Although credited as being on the album, Mick had nothing to do with (early 1995 release) Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat. He also denies the existence of Crowz, saying that "the secret album everyone talks about is just a bunch of leaked demo tapes and stuff."
Aside from Slipknot, he did a guitar solo for a Malevolent Creation song.</p>

<p>Thomson joined Slipknot in the summer of 1996, replacing Craig Jones on guitar after he became the band's full-time sampler. The first Slipknot album on which Thomson performed was the 1999 self-titled debut. Speaking about the process of recording the album, he recalled in an interview for Revolver magazine that "It was a nightmarish hell to do that fucking record", primarily due to the group's lack of money, poor quality of food, and other band members' bad habits.<br><br>

Upon joining the band, Thomson wore a hockey mask which he bought from a store, compared by author Joel McIver to that worn by Hannibal Lecter in the film The Silence of the Lambs. The guitarist's mask would remain much the same throughout his career, with only minor changes made for each album cycle, which he claimed was because he "pretty much nailed it ... for being able to get across how I am". Speaking in 2008, Thomson played down the amount of consideration which went into the mask's design and meaning, proclaiming that "I had my original latex hockey mask way back and then my leather one and I was using those designs and it morphed into what it is now. There isn't something crazy creative about it." Thomson also chose #7 in the band, claiming that it was his "lucky number".<br><br>

Outside of Slipknot, Thomson has collaborated with several other bands. Along with Slipknot bassist Paul Gray, he appeared on a Death tribute album organised by James Murphy. In 2007, he performed the second guitar solo on Malevolent Creation's "Deliver My Enemy", released on Doomsday X. Speaking about his appearance on the song, which was engineered in part by Slipknot DJ Sid Wilson, Thomson claimed that he was "proud beyond words to have been asked to be part of this recording".In 2011, he performed guest lead guitar on Necrophagia's album Deathtrip 69. Thomson is also featured in the music video for "No Pity on the Ants" by thrash metal band Lupara, directed by Frankie Nasso and released in 2007.</p>

<h2>Jim Root</h2><input type="button" class="btn sty" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo3" value="&#x25bc" style="color: black;">
<div id="demo3" class="collapse">
<p> James Donald "Jim" Root,  is an American musician known for being the rhythm guitarist for the heavy metal band Slipknot, and the former lead guitarist for alternative metal band Stone Sour</p>

<p>Born October 2, 1971<br><br>
        also known by his number #4,The Peach, Mr. Bigs, The Jester, Stuperbee, The Paint Face</p>

<p>James Root began performing with the thrash metal band Atomic Opera from Iowa in the early 90s, not to be confused with the hard rock band Atomic Opera from Houston, Texas. Soon after they split up he went on to perform in bands such as DeadFront and Stone Sour; the latter which he joined in 1995, and returned to along with vocalist Corey Taylor, during its revival in 2002, and left in 2014. Prior to joining Slipknot, he worked as a screenprinter, waiter, and busboy.<br><br>

Although filling in the spot of rhythm guitar in 1999, Root is considered to be one of the band's main songwriters and has written lead guitar parts for Slipknot's later albums particularly on All Hope is Gone. Root typically performed lead guitar in Stone Sour, although he sometimes played rhythm. He has spoken of both bands' guitar style as being twin guitar: "In both bands, I fulfill both roles. In Slipknot, Mick [Thomson] has some solos, and in Stone Sour, Josh [Rand] has some solos." During the recording of Stone Sour's Audio Secrecy, he and Rand recorded their parts simultaneously.<br><br>

Outside Slipknot and Stone Sour, Root has appeared on Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson's DJ Starscream album The New Leader and John 5's The Devil Knows My Name, for the song "Black Widow of La Porte", and also appeared on the Roadrunner United project, performing the solo and harmony guitars on "Tired 'N Lonely" from the project's album The All-Star Sessions. He also appeared on Jonathan Davis and the SFA´s cover of Lil Wayne´s "Got Money".<br><br></p>

<p>Root has been in a relationship with Lacuna Coil singer Cristina Scabbia since 2004. This is seen on both their social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. He currently owns a home in Atlantic Beach, Florida.<br><br></p>

<p>On 17th May 2014, Stone Sour released an official statement saying that Root was no longer a member of the band.<br>
Root has rarely been seen singing backup vocals. He sang in "Get Inside", "Inhale" and "Last of the Real".</p><br><br>

<div id="start_Craig">

<h2>Craig Jones</h2><input type="button" class="btn sty" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo2" value="&#x25bc" style="color: black;">
<div id="demo2" class="collapse">
<p> Craig Michael Jones (born February 11, 1972), also known as 133 (or 133 mHz) , Pinhead, The Silent One, or by his number #5, is an American musician, best known as the sampler of the Grammy Award-winning band Slipknot. </p>

<p>Jones was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He previously played in various local extreme metal bands, including Modifidious, before joining Slipknot in February 1996. He was the replacement for the band's original guitarist, Donnie Steele, who left during the recording of their first songs, put together into a demo called Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat which the band themselves have stated is not an album, but a demo. Because the band was almost completed with the demo, he did not contribute to it, but he did receive credit for its sleeve concept and graphics in the liner notes. Before the year was over, Jones had been replaced by guitarist Mick Thomson, and he began to assume his role as the band's sampler and keyboardist.<br><br>
Jones is the only member of the band who is not interviewed completely unmasked on Voliminal: Inside the Nine. While he does not wear a mask during the interview, his face remains obstructed by a constant blur. Also, he does not speak during the segment featured on the film, nor during the extended version of the footage featured on user-submitted content websites such as YouTube (originally from the Outside The Nine released DVD: Fan Club Propaganda Reel 1). He also speaks for 2 seconds at the beginning of Welcome To Our Neighborhood. He says,"133, number 5, sampling."</p>

<p>His background is unquestionably the most elusive of any other member of Slipknot, so much that he has been known to keep silence throughout even a series of questions. That is why he earned his second nickname, The Silent One.This is not to say he has never spoken outside the confines of the band, however. In fact, Jones has engaged an interview with Cakewalk regarding their equipment, which he prefers when performing Sampling. He begins most interviews with the zipper covering his mouth opened, and closes the zipper before making any reply to the questions asked. Jones prompted a burst of complaint letters when, another time he broke his silence during an interview, he was quoted as having made the sole statement that, "If I wasn't in this band, I'd probably be out killing people!" He has answered this question also, "If I wasn't in the band today, I'd be driving forklifts in a warehouse all day long."<br><br>

Former Slipknot vocalist Anders Colsefini has implied that Jones is a misanthrope. While expressing distaste for Jones' behavior, Colsefini revealed that Jones was in fact the inspiration for the song "Killers Are Quiet". However a close friend of the band at the time, Frank Plumley, is credited for the song's fitting title. Colsefini provided further insight into Jones' personality when he claimed that, "Computers are Craig's best friend." According to Music producer Ross Robinson, Jones was disturbingly quiet during their studio sessions.<br><br>

However, contrary to popular belief, Jones has been known to be very open and somewhat talkative with fans after Slipknot's performances. This may suggest that his dangerously taciturn behavior is an affectation or exaggeration for the sake of publicity and/or intrigue. Some have commented that the "serial killer" comments he has made may be his attempt at dark humor, in addition to his preference to speak during interviews exclusively with the zipper covering his mouth closed. However he has done two online text interviews after the release of the Slipknot (album), and readers of the interview have noticed that online he is a lot less hostile than he lets on. In the video of the making of Sulfur Craig Jones is actually shown talking to the camera.<br><br>

On Nine: The Making of All Hope Is Gone, the DVD that comes with the special edition of All Hope Is Gone, Craig is the only member of the band to have his face pixelation while everyone else appears with their face clear and uncensored.

<h2>Shawn Crahan</h2><input type="button" class="btn sty" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo5" value="&#x25bc" style="color: black;">
<div id="demo5" class="collapse">

<p>Michael Shawn "Clown" Crahan, is a percussionist in Slipknot. He uses a set of deeply tuned toms(drums). He has a height of 5'7". According to Slipknot, he was one of the first band members to wear a mask (he had an old clown mask). He found his mask sitting lonely in a shop one day and he decided "it was right" afterwards, the rest of the band's members started wearing masks</p>

<p>Born on September 24, 1969 Des Moines, Iowa <br> <br>

Also known as:#6, Clown, Kong</p>

<p>In 1993, Crahan formed a metal band known as "The Pale Ones" with fellow musician Paul Gray, which featured himself as the band's drummer. Wanting to expand the band's percussion section, Crahan brought in Joey Jordison to fill in as drummer while Crahan's efforts were focused on custom percussion, giving the band a distinct sound. In 1996, they released a song known as Slipknot, and through Joey's suggestion, the band changed their name to Slipknot and released their first official album. This album would later become known to the band as their demo. Crahan felt that the original vocalist for Slipknot was too guttural, and was the primary reason for Slipknot's inability to get a record deal. He brought in Corey Taylor from another local band called Stone Sour, whose vocals were more melodic. Slipknot got a record deal a couple years later and released their first official album in 1999. Slipknot gained major notability the same year by touring with Ozzfest. In Slipknot's early years, Crahan brought several dead pig heads on stage.<br><br>

As well as lending his percussion talents to the band, Crahan has also sung backing vocals on a number of songs Slipknot has both recorded and performed live. He also wrote the original draft of "Tattered & Torn", which originally appeared on the band's first album, Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. which featured the original singer of Slipknot before Corey Taylor was brought in as a replacement. This album has since been considered a demo by the band, and their 1999 self-titled album is now considered their first actual album. A second version of Tattered & Torn was released on their self-titled album, and is the version that most people know.<br><br>

Outside Slipknot, Crahan has founded Big Orange Clown Records, a vanity label within Sanctuary Records, which has so far signed the metalcore band Gizmachi. He also acted as director for, and assembled Slipknot's 2005 DVD, Voliminal: Inside the Nine, while the band engaged a brief hiatus.<br><br>

He also performed with To My Surprise, recording guitar and vocals for the band's self-titled debut album. The band received little interest due to their album being released amidst the success of Slipknot members Corey Taylor, James Root and Joey Jordison's side projects, Stone Sour and the Murderdolls, respectively. To My Surprise was later dropped by Roadrunner Records. In 2007, Crahan began performing as drummer for Dirty Little Rabbits. The band was a supporting act for Stone Sour during their North American tour in Summer 2007, and have released one EP, titled Breeding. They have since signed a deal with The End Records as of November, 2008.<br><br>

In 2009 he contributed to Bring Me the Horizon's remix album, Suicide Season: Cut Up!, by remixing the track "Sleep With One Eye Open". Also in 2009 Shawn remixed a Suicide Silence track on their Wake Up EP entitled "Wake Up (Clown of Slipknot Remix)". In 2010, he contributed to Escape the Fate's This War Is Ours deluxe edition, by remixing the track "This War Is Ours (The Guillotine Part II)" and in 2011 he remixed "Angels of Clarity" for Dead by April on their compilation album "Stronger". Crahan has confirmed the formation of a brand new side project called The Black Dots of Death who released their debut studio album Ever Since We Were Children on March 28, 2011. He is the director of many of Slipknot's music videos, DVDs and other artistic projects. He also directed the 'We Are' videoclip from the band Hollywood Undead.<br><br>

Crahan generally wears clown-style masks while performing with Slipknot, however on occasion, when performing the band's song "Vermilion", all band members will wear their own death masks instead.<br><br>

He also features as the carny "Tamer" in The Devil's Carnival, a short film directed by Darren Lynn Bousman to be screened on tour beginning in April, 2012.<br><br></p>

<p>Crahan has been credited with several things that Slipknot is known for, such as their masks. Crahan began wearing a clown mask to rehearsals as a joke when the band was still fairly unknown, spawning the mask theme that the band is known for today. He is also credited with coining the term "maggots" to describe Slipknot's fans, stating that as maggots feed off of dead flesh, the youth that make up the majority of Slipknot's fan-base feed off of the dead flesh of society.<br><br>

Crahan has had several masks throughout his career with Slipknot, all of which are clown themed except for his "death mask", which was used in the video for the song "Vermillion". Crahan's earliest known mask and perhaps his most referenced one is one that he used during Slipknot's earliest self-titled album which is a happy looking clown mask, balding with long orange hair.</p>

<p>Christopher Michael Fehn is one of two percussionists in the nu metal band Slipknot. Chris uses a Pinocchio-style mask, which has been seen in many different colors and styles with the nose of the mask always staying at 71/2 inches (about 19 cm) long. Chris's mask is most likely based on the masks worn by doctors during the Black Plague, where the nose was filled with herbs to 'protect' the doctor from inhaling the fumes of death, or possibly on the mask Alex wore during the rape scene from the film A Clockwork Orange. Chris likes to simulate masturbation with the nose of his mask during shows. Chris was a college football kicker before the start of Slipknot. He does most of the backup vocals together with Shawn "Clown" Crahan.</p>


<p>he played as a kicker on the Wayne State University Football team. Fehn joined the band around April 1997, replacing percussionist Greg Welts, who was forced out of Slipknot after the band due to personal conflicts with drummer Joey Jordison which stemmed from Welts dating Jordison's sister. Fehn stands 6'1" in height and is of Norwegian descent.<br><br>

As well as lending his percussion talents to the band, Fehn has also sung backing vocals on a number of songs Slipknot has both recorded and performed live. Outside Slipknot, Fehn is a very keen golfer, and evidences this on the band's 2006 DVD, Voliminal: Inside the Nine, where he is interviewed while playing golf. Fehn describes himself as a "big fan of the band" and says of Slipknot, "the world needed something like this." Slipknot bassist Paul Gray stated in an interview that Fehn "often brings humor to the band." and that they "definitely need that guy." Prior to joining Slipknot in 1997, Fehn was close friends with Slipknot's percussionist Shawn Crahan. According to Fehn, he had originally asked Crahan if he could be drummer Joey Jordison's drum tech. Shortly after his request was made, Fehn was given an offer to play custom percussion in the band. Fehn was then given a rough demo that contained all of Slipknot's songs. Fehn has said that "Spit It Out" was the song that stood out to him the most. Fehn then tried out on percussion and was subsequently made part of Slipknot. Of the nine members, Chris was the eighth to join the band.<br><br>

In the early years of Slipknot before their signing with Roadrunner Records, Fehn was an electrician. In a recent interview with Face Culture, Fehn said that the band members gave him a hard time in his early years with the band. He described that his time during the self-titled album era was his "hazing period" with the band.<br><br>

His mask was featured in the movie Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.

On March 23, 2012 Chris welcomed his son into the world.</p>
